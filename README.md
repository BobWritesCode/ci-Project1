## Objective
In this project I intent to create a website that provides some basic information on why people should choose popcorn and how to make popcorn.

The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS.  There are some small sections with other languages such as JavaScipt but this is purely included to enhance the user experience.

The website is designed to be responsive between different devices and the use of the site to be intuative by any user.

**The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely for the purpose of completing my Code Institute project**
***
## Brief
The goal of this website is to provide the end user basic information to why they should choose popcorn as a snack.  
My goals for the site are to have:
- a eye catching front page with short sentences to engage the user.
- a receipe page to help users make their own popcorn.
- a gallerry show casing popcorn aswell as a YouTube video.
- a contact form, where a user can submit information.
- a uniform approach so all pages other then the homepage have a familar look and style.

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design
### User Requirements
Some example user stories which will affect the design
 
- *"As a first time visitor, I want to know what this site is about. I may use a number of different devices (mobile/tablet etc.) to view the site. I would like to be able to navigate easily"*
- *"As a returning visitor, I want to be able to navigate to the page I want without getting lost"*
- *"As a unexperienced popcorn maker, I want to be able to follow instructions to making popcorn and have a way so I don't get lost where I am in the process."*
***
### Initial Concept
I hope to be able to deliver a website that does not overload the user with too many distractions (i.e. like out of place imagery, distracting backgrounds). The site needs to be easy to navigate for the user. 
A key focus is to deliver a high level experience for mobile, tablet and PC users.

#### Wireframes

## Bugs

![White line between blocks](assets/docs/line-bug.png)\
**Bug:** A white line appeared between the hero image and the block for the header.\
**Solution:** Incase the header and hero image in a div and add *style="font-size: 0;"* as an attribute to the div.

**Bug:** Other elements apeparing on top of collasible menu.\
**Solution:** Add *z-index:99;* to .menus class to make sure menus are always on top.

I have modified this code as the original has the line come from bottom left and go of to bottom right. I preferred the line to go back to the bottom left, as this looked better when going between the different links in the nav bar.
