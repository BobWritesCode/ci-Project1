**Bug:** A white line appeared between the hero image and the block for the header.\
**Solution:** Incase the header and hero image in a div and add *style="font-size: 0;"* as an attribute to the div.

I have modified this code as the original has the line come from bottom left and go of to bottom right. I preferred the line to go back to the bottom left, as this looked better when going between the different links in the nav bar.
