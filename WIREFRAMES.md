# **Wireframes and End Results**

## Introduction

As part of the initial planning stages I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These allowed me to hit the ground running with a initial design plan.

Throughout the production of creating the website on self-reflection and feedback from others I made design changes. Most of these changes were to accommodate a more aesthetically pleasing site, as well as making the site work better responsively.

## Overall desgin changes
- Originally I planned for PC to have a 60% width page container. But after feedback that there was too much white space on the sides. I redesigned the site to be 90% width on all devices. 
- This also meant I changed the width of the nav bar, header bar, and footer to be 100% width of the page.
