# **Wireframes and end results**

## Introduction

As part of the initial planning stages I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These allowed me to hit the ground running with a initial design plan.

Throughout the production of creating the website on self-reflection and feedback from others I made design changes. Most of these changes were to accommodate a more aesthetically pleasing site, as well as making the site work better responsively.

## Homepage (index.html)

The wireframe above is the original design for the homepage for PC, Tablet and mobile. It also showcases the original idea for the tablet and mobile menu.

Originally I planned for PC to have a 60% width page container. But after feedback that there was too much white space on the sides. I redeisgned the site to be 90% width on all devices. 

This also meant I changed the width of the nav bar, header bar, and footer to be 100% width of the page.

I also made a design change to the sections under the header on PC to be paired, and on ultra wide screens they would triple for each row.

The wireframe above is the original design for the How to make for PC, Tablet and mobile.

As before originally for PC it has the 60% width design which following feedback I changed to 90% screen width.

Another change I made for PC to elimate unsused white space was to move the image on PC to the right of the ingrediants and instructions.

A change that I made for all devices was to move away from the proposed grid format and to a more fluid design.
